# The story about the origin of this Jounal Club
Once upon a time, a lazy biology student found that he needed a pusher to read more paper. Then the student cooperated with a lot of DaLaos to do it together so that everyone could benefit from it.

# Objective 
This journal club has 3 major purposes.
1. To help everyone gain sight and knowledge from more field as much as possible. 🤓
2. To push everyone to read journals and learn basic experiment methods. :muscle:
3. To illumine some great ideas and cultivate critical thinking. 🤔

# How to select a journal
1. you can choose the one with cool and basic methods that most of students may apply one day.
2. you can chhose the one with interesting topic.

# What do you need?
## If you are the presenter or leader🧐
1. You should choose the journal carefully and wisely and post it on WeChat group in advance so that everyone has sufficient time to read it.
2. A PPT is not necessarily needed but you have to well prepare it.
3. Show the author and lab of the journal. Maybe such an unimpressive action will set a great goal for participants.

## If you are participants🙋
1.You need to read the journal in advance and make sure that you do think carefully about it.

All in all, respect everyone in the club! <img src="https://github.com/marsdream6/picture/blob/main/7993b0c5be82b151d19ed62520c4795.png?raw=true">
