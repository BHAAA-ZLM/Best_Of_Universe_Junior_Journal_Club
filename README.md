## The story about the origin of this Jounal Club
Once upon a time, a lazy biology student found that he needed a pusher to read more paper. Then the student cooperated with a lot of DaLaos to do it together so that everyone could benefit from it.

## Objective 
This journal club has 3 major purposes.
1. Helping everyone gain knowledge and insight into more fields (as much as possible). 🤓
2. Pushing everyone to read journals and learn basic experiment methods. :muscle:
3. Illumining some great ideas and cultivating critical thinking. 🤔

## How to select an article
1. You can choose one introducing cool and basic methods that most of the students may apply one day.
2. You can choose one with an interesting topic.

## What do you need?
### If you are the presenter or leader🧐
1. You should choose the journal carefully and wisely and post it on WeChat group in advance so that everyone has sufficient time to read it.
2. A PPT is not necessarily needed, but you have to show us your best effort. Innovations are strongly encouraged.
3. A suggested format of the presentation is: Background $\rightarrow$ the Article (including methods and results) $\rightarrow$ Your critics $\rightarrow$ Discussion.

### If you are participants🙋
